一老外找一导游～～・以下是其自述：
I\'ll be in Beijing from July 26,27,28 and 29. Leaving July 30th. I\'d like to visit Forbidden City, Dian An Men, Summer Palace and Great Wall. In addition, I also want to visit other main attraction areas, as well as 
local place where local people go. If anybody is interested, she can contact
