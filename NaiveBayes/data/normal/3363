===================
not really, except love itself, usually what they care is the ability, just the same as the other girls
degree is one way to prove your ability. if you have another way to prov
e that, it should not be a problem
and i believe you need more confidence    :)
finally, MAYBE, you love her more than she loves u, and u know it well 
bless u 2 ~~
: 呵呵，不打算问了，问这个觉得自己太小气了。。。就是想知道女博士是不是都对学历看的重！
