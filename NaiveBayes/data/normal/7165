"This is no ordinary Fatal Attraction-style thriller, 
however; Audition slowly and carefully builds into a 
wrenching exploration of both deep male fears and the 
stereotype of the cute, submissive Japanese woman. Audition 
is by no means an easy movie to watch--even hardcore horror 
fans may have trouble--but it will stay with you for a long, 
long time." --Ali Davis 
:   就x镜头来说不如，就bt和虐待镜头来说，我觉得"Audition"要震撼一些。
