They 
Who made up all the rules
We follow them like fools
Believe them to be true
Don’t care to think them through
And I’m sorry so sorry
I’m sorry it’s like this
I’m sorry so sorry
I’m sorry we do this
And it’s ironic too
Coz what we tend to do
Is act on what they say
And then it is that way
And I’m sorry so sorry
I’m sorry it’s like this
I’m sorry so sorry
I’m sorry we do this
Who are they
And where are they
And how can they possibly
know all this
Who are they
And where are they
And how can they possibly
know all this
Do you see what I see
Why do we live like this
Is it because it’s true
that ignorance is bliss
Who are they
And where are they
And how do they
know all this
And I’m sorry so sorry
I’m sorry it’s like this
Do you see what I see
Why do we live like this
Is it because it’s true
that ignorance is bliss
And who are they
And where are they
And how can they
know all this
And I’m sorry so sorry
I’m sorry we do this
